# OmniArt Eye Classifier
This package is an (painted) eye colour classifier. It is trained on a dataset of 2600 different painted eyes that were extracted from the [OmniArt](http://isis-data.science.uva.nl/strezoski/#2) dataset.
The model achieved an accuracy of 83% for following ten classes:
``amber, blue, brown, gray, grayscale, green, hazel, irisless, negative, red.``
The ``negative`` is used to classify images that are not eyes, or where, for example, the eye lid is closed.










### Project origin
This package is part of a Master's thesis at the University of Amsterdam.
